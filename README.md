To edit the book : 

- Navigate to the md file you want to edit and click the pencil icon (edit button) to modify the file content.
- If you want to add a chapter, create and save a new markdown file and add its name in the toc file.
- Enter a commit message (e.g., “Add requirements.txt”).
- Choose the option to commit directly to the main or master branch.
- Click Commit

  Once you commit the changes, they are automatically added to the repository and the jupyter book will update automatically.
