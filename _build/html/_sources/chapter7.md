# Thesis Closure

When you undertake a master's thesis project, you contribute to scientific activities in a research laboratory. Many scientific activities are progressive, meaning that the work you do will be based on scientific resources produced by other scientists and your predecessors, and your work may potentially be used by your successors. Scientific efficiency is enhanced when the transfer of scientific resources between different generations of scientists and master's students is smooth. Therefore:

Scientific work builds progressively. Your thesis is based on resources produced by other scientists, and your work may contribute to future research. It is important that your work is properly archived when you leave the laboratory.

In addition to submitting your thesis document, which is detailed [here], it is your responsibility to submit your scientific archives. The procedure is as follows:

## Content of the Scientific Archive**
  - A metafile, or a README.txt file, explaining the content of the scientific archive, including the type of files and their description.
  - Specific documents used during the master's thesis (e.g., protocols, manuals, etc.).
  - Presentations: presentation materials developed for the accompanying seminars and the final defense.
  - Specific data collected or used during the master's thesis. Original data that can be collected from other generic resources (e.g., GEE) should not be included.
  - Specific data processing files (programs, scripts used during the thesis).
  - A digital version of the final master's thesis.

## Format of the Scientific Archive**
  - The archive must be stored in a structured, zipped directory readable by MS-Windows.
  - The directory structure must be clear, logical, and well-organized.
  - Directory and file names must be explicit.
  - The README.txt file must be in *.txt format.

## Transfer of Scientific Archives**
  - The archive must be transferred to the supervisor via a data transfer application. At UCLouvain, [the TRANSVOL application](https://intranet.uclouvain.be/fr/myucl/services-informatiques/transfert-de-fichier-volumineux-transvol-belnet.htm). However, you can also use a free tool like [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/).
